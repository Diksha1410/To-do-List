# Project Description :
1) First of all, we created a empty list named as "todo_list".
2) We are printing four options for the user to choose from:
3) 1: "Add an item to list", 2: "Remove an item from list", 3: "Show all the tasks", and 4: "Quit".
4) The code then asks for input from the user and checks if it is a valid choice.
5) If the user inputs 1, then they will be asked to enter an item and it will be added to the list.
6) If the user input 2, then they are given a choice of which item in the list that they want to remove.
7) If the user inputs 3, then they can see all the list of items in their to-do list.
8) Finally, if user enters 4, the program will quit. 
9) We have used "enumerate" function to loop through all items in the list and print them out one at a time.
10) Also we used "choice" method by which the user can randomly select element from the specified sequence.
